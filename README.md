Santa Monica College CS20A Solo Student Project

Finding Nemo is an SMC student project that creates a maze, and utilizes a stack, queue and linked list class created by the developers of
the game. The character searches for an exit to a maze using depth-first search, or a breadth first search (depending on which you want), with backtracking fully functional.
